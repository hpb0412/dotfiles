# Khoa Do's Neovim

This is my `Lua` configuaration for my modern Neovim

## Requirement

- Neovim 0.6.1+
- MacOS Monterey 12.1 (and above)

## Notes

Since this configuaration target MacOS there are some notes for you if you want to reuse on other OSs

- `Options` key (a.k.a `Alt` key on other systems)
  On Mac, with standard international keyboard layout, everytime you use `<Options + number | letter>`
  you we recieve a Greek character.

  Therefore, once you need a combination of `<Options + number|letter>`, instead of using `<A-`, you
  should used the corresponding Greek character of that combination. Example:

  - `<A-j>` will be `‚àÜ`
  - `<A-k>` will be `Àö`

- Too fast `timeoutlen` (of `lua/kd/options.lua`) may cause trouble for several tools
  - My current setup is `500ms` and it works very well for commenting stuff with my `gcc` key binding
  - But fastening it with `100ms` makes the commenting with `gcc` key binding not work anymore
